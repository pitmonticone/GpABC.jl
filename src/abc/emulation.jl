Run emulation-based rejection ABC algorithm. Model simulation results are used to train the
emulator, which is then used to get the approximated distance for each particle. The rest
of the workflow is similar to [`SimulatedABCRejection`](@ref).

Run emulation-based ABC-SMC algorithm. This is similar to [`EmulatedABCRejection`](@ref),
the main difference being that an array of thresholds is provided instead of a single threshold.
It is assumed that thresholds are sorted in decreasing order.

An emulation based ABC iteration is executed for each threshold. For the first threshold, the provided prior is used.
For each subsequent threshold, the posterior from the previous iteration is used as a prior.

See [ABC Overview](@ref abc-overview) for more details.

- `simulator_function::Function`: A function that takes a parameter vector as an argument and outputs model results.

- `threshold_schedule::AbstractArray{Float,1}`: The threshold schedule to be used in ABC algorithm. An ABC iteration is executed for each threshold. It is assumed that thresholds are sorted in decreasing order.

- `emulator_training<:AbstractEmulatorTraining`: This determines how the emulator will be trained for each iteration. See [`AbstractEmulatorTraining`](@ref) for more details.
- `emulator_retraining<:AbstractEmulatorRetraining`: This is used to specify parameters of additional emulator retraining that can be done for each iteration. By default this retraining is switched off ([`NoopRetraining`](@ref)). See [`AbstractEmulatorRetraining`] for more details.
