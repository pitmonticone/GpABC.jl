# [Stochastic Inference (LNA) Overview](@id lna-overview)

Biochemical reactions are stochastic in nature, and the distribution of stochastic simulation trajectories is generally non-Gaussian. To meet the Gaussian noise assumption of a GP and to consider computational efficiency, we employ the linear noise approximation (LNA), a first-order expansion of the Chemical Master Equation (CME) by decomposing the stochastic process into two ordinary differential equations (ODEs); one describing the evolution of the mean and the other describing the evolution of the covariance of the trajectories $\textbf{x}(t)$ (i.e. $\mathbf{x}(t)\sim \mathcal{N}(\phi(t),\Sigma(t))$):

```math
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}&=S\cdot \mathbf{a}(\phi(t)) \label{mean} \\
\frac{d\Sigma(t)}{dt}&=S\cdot J \cdot \Sigma(t) + \Sigma(t) \cdot (J\cdot S)^T+
\Omega^{-1/2} S\cdot \mathrm{diag} \{\mathbf{a}(\phi(t))\} \cdot S^T \label{covar}
\end{align*}
```

Here $S$ is the stoichiometry matrix of the system, $\textbf{a}$ is the reaction propensity vector. The $J(t)_{jk}=\partial a_j/\partial \phi_k$ is the Jacobian of the $j^{th}$ reaction with respect to the $k^{th}$ variable.

These can be solved by numerical methods to describe how $\phi(t)$ (the mean) and $\Sigma(t)$ (the covariance) evolve with time. We can then draw samples from the above (time-dependent) multivariate Gaussian distribution and obtain realizations of stochastic simulation trajectories. Those trajectories can therefore be used for stochastic simulation based ABC. Please see Examples Section for more details.
